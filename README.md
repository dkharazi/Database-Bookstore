## Instructions

To use the SQL statements contained in this folder, a compatible DBMS software must be found (ie. MySQL, SQLLite Manager, etc.). Afterwards, the following SQL files can be run to setup the tables in your database:  

1. Run the 'SQLCreate.sql' file, which will setup all of the tables in the database. The create statements define the tables, attributes, and constraints of the database.  
2. Run the 'SQLInsert.sql' file, which will insert all of the entries into the tables. The insert statements will have to adhere to the attribute definitions and constraints from the 'create' statements.
3. Run the 'SQLQueries.sql' file, which will query certain tables and output the results in a newly defined table. The query statements will return the results of finding specific entries in all of the tables, whether the result is a single element, a list of elements, or an entirely new table.
4. Run the 'SQLInsertDelete.sql' file, which contain examples of adding and removing entries from the table.
